I was disconnected after being after being on hold for 40 minutes, then called back and told that the order was cancelled and the tire center closed early, and they would have to be reordered and try the whole thing over another day! Every time you call to ask for the tire department you have to listen to a prerecorded 5 minute recorded spiel about Covid 19 before you can even press a department number to talk to someone and the Auto center isn’t one of them you have to go through the switchboard first and Wait for someone to answer and then ask them to transfer you to the auto center then you have to wait for someone to answer that phone which if they don’t in 5 minutes or so then you have to go back through the switch board and start all over! So if you don’t have a job and can spend a few days trying to get your tires put on to save a few bucks on some cheap tires maybe that’s fine, if not go another route!',\n",

My husband and I had “dates” on the phone ordering his groceries. We would discuss his meals for the week including his lunches for work, I’d add what he needed into the cart through the app then I would place the order for him to pick up at the Walmart around the corner from our home in Wyoming where he was at. I would always add something special and extra; his favorite dessert, a snack I thought he like for his lunch. Then after he’s pick up his order, which was always easy quick and simple at our Laramie Wy Walmart, he’d call to tell me what he got elated by the special items I’d thrown in he didn’t know about. \\nIt was so easy I’ve done it now for my kids too for those holidays we couldn’t be together I’d buy them a meal. When they were feeling down and I thought they could use a banana split night with friends I’d order up all the makings and have them pick up their order at their local Walmart. And never ever a problem with ordering or picking up ( outside of shortages during hoarding but that wasn’t a flaw in your system just our nations mentality)\\nThank you Walmart for making it easy to continue loving my family through food even when I can’t be there next to them.',\n",

I also spoke to a wonderful woman who tried to put me through to a manager or co-manager to make a complaint about the customer service could not get through to them never got a callback as promised will continue to shop at sawdust location but I believe online Walmart employees who use this app should have a spot to add their discount employee card number to receive the discount they deserve I had several items that needed discounts and did not get them very very upsetting and frustrating. Also very upset that I never received a call back from management unacceptable that’s not how management should be run I used to be a store manager not with Walmart but a different grocery train and you were given a message to call the customer you better be calling that customer back no exceptions complaint or not you take what you’re given it goes with a job title. Thank you for listening and I will continue to use this app but I’m very disappointed that the items I purchase can’t be given my discount I believe those items I’ll pick up in store along with my meats and frozen foods thank you for listening',\n",

This is terrible  furthermore, I have to spend almost 20 mins. On the phone with customer support trying to get all the missing items refunded. Also, lately, I’ve been getting a lot of expired food and rotten food food that’s bad lunchmeat that’s about to go bad it lasts maybe 24 hours then has slime all over it. It’s disgusting I don’t know. It’s poor quality at this particular Walmart or what but this Walmart that I’m speaking about has only been an operation for maybe five years so it’s pretty much a brand new Walmart anyway I hope Corporate reads this probably not, but if they do, I hope they do some about it cause I know I’m not the only person complaining I’m about to take my money to ShopRite now that they do deliveries I know that their orders are going to be accurate.

I got into a little bit of trouble in my younger years when I picked some things up at Walmart that didn’t belong to me. And I got in trouble when I went out the door. I was told never to go back into Walmart ever again but I continue to go back into Walmart and I continued to shoplift. I haven’t stolen anything from Walmart since 2014. When I go into Walmart I give the employees a great deal of respect. I got into a little bit more trouble and my attorney was able to get my Walmart charges dismissed because I picked up some federal charges. Now I shop at Walmart probably five days a week and I probably spend at least 3000 a month there. When my little boy acts out in Walmart or for instance once he put some thing in his pocket I brought him back inside and made him tell them what he had done. And he ask out and he screams and yells I take him to the front and let him know that he’s on a camera and this is not how you act in public or at home and the Walmart employees have always went above and beyond to help me correct my seven-year-old son. Walmart truly does go above and beyond andI’m happy to call Walmart my family any day of the week! Yay Walmart keep on providing excellent customer service!

When one wants to reorder something, typically it is not available at one\\'s Walmart store location of choice for an unacceptably prolonged period of time - if Walmart wanted to do more business and satisfy its customers, it would keep much better track of inventory and keep its stores stocked with items in demand in a much more timely fashion, instead of expecting customers to go to other much less convenient locations to get the items they want.  Also, when Walmart sends emails to notify customers that items are ready for pickup, it gives false instructions.  In my most recent experience, the email instructed me to drive to \"pick up\" to have the item brought to my car, but when I arrived, not only did the employee who answered the \"pick up area\" phone line tell me I could not pick up my items there as the email instructed, but he hung up on me when I questioned him about why the email gave false instructions.

The search filters don’t lock so you wind up having half your crap in a separate cart where they want you to pay for shipping when you are trying to do a pickup order! Then, half of what you want is “out of stock”! Twice I have tested this, showing out of stock for pickup while in the store looking at the item. Not to mention, you have no control over your order. On Instacart, you can work with your shopper on replacements and extras. On Walmart, your order has to be placed usually the day before, half the stuff is for shipping only, leaving you no option but to go elsewhere for those items, and you don’t know if you will get everything until 30 minutes before pickup where they don’t let you choose replacements! Horrible. If you don’t pay attention to other shopping apps, you will fall behind in this game. I canceled my Walmart+ because every time I did delivery my order got stolen by the drive and your app redesign makes shopping stressful and inconvenient. How do you expect to keep customers with this horrible thing? Improve your shopping experience for app users, and I might be back. Good luck with this travesty.

We were then rudely told that no one was home (uh, yes we were) so the ordered was returned by the driver, that the store was closed, and to call back at 8am to get my order rescheduled. What?!

At checkout, the app apparently changed the location to a different store without a warning or confirmation. So we drove to the location we had been using for over a year. We check in using the app that no longer uses location to make sure you’re in the right place. We waited for over 20 minutes until an employee that brought out a different order, checked for our order. He informed us that he didn’t have an order. So we checked our information for the order only to find out what had happened. We then had to drive an extra 15 miles to get our order. I’m not sure who thought that the new app was a good idea, designed it, or approved it, but in my opinion, every one of these has failed to provide a useful app. I’m not even sure that this review will do any good, other than to let other people see that this app has so many issues that it is almost not worth using.',\n",

I went back to the cart, then the air mattress wouldn’t ship I would have to go to the store for that.  So I went in and put the bug spray back on, since I had to go to the store anyway now. I moved everything to curb side pick up. A day later I get a message that the air mattress and bug spray are sold out.  I had to sign up for the app to find that out. When I read that, I got a text saying my order is ready for pick up. I wasn’t posted until 12:30 pm today. But was sent 12:05 am.  So I wasted all morning waiting to be told I need to go to the store to pick up items that were able to be sent to the house. So I have to drive to the store to pick up three things I could have had yesterday if I drove to the store, went in a purchased them. I could have sealed my tent yesterday and packed up by now but I had to wait till today. I won’t be home until 1:30. By the time I seal the tent and let it dry I have to pack it away tomorrow. So I’ve been put out for two days only to get three of the six items I need.  That the app told me that you have can ship them then, can’t ship must pick up, to no we really don’t have those products.  What a waste of time and effort. Now you want a nick name only to say I can’t us it because it is taken.',\n",

If I’m in the store, I can launch the app, and enter a product name in the search box to search for a product to find out where it’s at and go directly to it instead of wasting time walking all over the store looking for it. I can also review the price and other product related information, so I don’t bother to look for it at all if the price is too high or some other reason. I could also simply have the product delivered to my home instead of walking over to it in the store - usually scheduling delivery the same day or next day, if it’s in stock! And if I’m not in the store, I can launch the app and search for a product, and then have it delivered, or pickup at the store! …in just a couple of minutes! Also, the app is designed “very well” for minimal clicks and fast and effective results, so I simply bring up the app, enter the product name in the search box, and Go! It’s actually fun to use. Great job with this app, Walmart!\\n\\nOne suggestion: when I select the “No Substitutions” slider and touch Done, it would be nice if it said that I selected that on the main screen so I don’t have to click into it again to confirm it’s selected when I don’t submit the order right away.',\n",

Today is the only day that I have bothered to fight my way through this app to execute purchases for delivery, rather than just struggling through going in person or taking my business elsewhere, solely based on the irritation caused by the overwhelming number of order for delivery to store or home products not in stock at the store which appear despite filtering.',\n",

The box arriving at my door looking as if it were tied to a rope and dragged behind UPS’s big brown delivery vehicle until it reached its final destination?! Thank goodness the bicycle manufacturer packed the bike well enough that it arrived within its severely tattered box unscathed. Assembly was quick and ALMOST FLAWLESS. THE BICYCLE LOOKED AMAZING as I finalized the assembly by inflating the tires. This is WHERE THE ISSUE AROSE, the front tire would not seal onto the wheel rim causing an unsightly bulbous tire hump exposing the inner tube. THE TIRE had a MANUFACTURING DEFECTIVE, making the newly assembled Christmas gift, unridable! No stores were open past 6pm on the 24th and definitely not open on the 25.

She sent me to the grocery pick up door to ask one of them. I asked three people standing next to this area and the team lead said that’s not true. She could’ve absolutely helped you. She proceeds to help me and says the app is never accurate and not to rely on it. I can’t rely on something that I wasn’t given any info on to begin with, I.e. what’s in stock where.

       "  'review': 'I used to love having an app for curbside pickup.  It was more challenging to shop for curbside pickup when it was merged into the other Walmart app, but I still managed.  Recently a new version of the app came out and it is terrible in many ways.  The search for food items is challenging.  I just searched for, “hamburger buns” and it couldn’t find any items.  I searched for, “buns” and the first thing listed was, “hamburger buns.” Meanwhile I couldn’t get anything searching for, “fudge stripes,” but was able to find various fudge stripe cookies using a four word phrase. Every search seems to take several tries to find a phrase that works.  Last time I ordered, the app told me that my order was delayed when it was ready.  This made it impossible to view and approve my substitutions. I finally called and found out that my order was ready.  Several hours after I picked up my order, the app notified me that it was ready for pickup.  The new app is hard to use on my iPhone because only half of the left column of item descriptions and buttons to click show up on my screen.  I have a time reserved for this evening, but getting through the ordering process is such an ordeal that I have decided that it will be quicker and easier to shop and a less expensive store in person.  I used to do Walmart Pickup orders 2-3 times a week because it was quick and easy, but now they hassle of dealing with the app outweighs the convenience of curbside pickup.',\n",

However, for the last month or so, I cannot check-in the way I used to when my pickup order was ready. I used to get a text and email. Now I only get an email, but when I try to check in with the email, there’s some sort of glitch. It doesn’t take me to the same screen in the app that it used to. It used to estimate my distance to the store I was picking up from, and then it would have me enter my parking space number when I arrived. For some odd reason, it doesn’t do that anymore. The associates are always nice and helpful in looking up my order, but I didn’t have to go through that process previously when the app was working correctly. Then today I am trying to add a couple of items to my pickup order for tomorrow, but it won’t let me add them to my existing order. It’s creating a new order instead and wanting to charge me a fee for not having a minimum $35 order. It will let me adjust quantities on items already in the pickup order, but it isn’t letting me add anything new. I used to have no problem adding items (within a certain time frame) after submitting the order so I don’t know why it’s a problem now.

If it’s not directly Sold By Walmart, expect to either not get a shipment at all or be sent something different than what you ordered. Pay close attention to what you’re clicking on!\\nI miss Ship Store To Store because my local stores often don’t have what I want in stock, but it will say it’s stocked in a store 300miles from me. I can’t go there, and can no longer ship for pickup at my local store, so that’s gone downhill.\\nMy Lists are more difficult to find in the app & require several clicks to finally get to. Sometimes I’ll see something in the run - while in a waiting room - and add it to a List to come back to to see if I want to order it, and trying ti get back to my List is more difficult; although I do appreciate having Lists. The app just needs to make them easier to find, like they used to be.\\n\\nThe app continues to go downhill, along with the physical stores. It’s sad, I used to do a lot of business grocery shopping & ordering with Walmart.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Not able to fulfill my whole order. Almost every time I order, I am not able to get the things I need. Yet at the same time, I know some of them are actually in the store and on the shelf. That's frustrating. It's also frustrating that I am paying for a service that isn't completely fulfilling the order. Then it feels like last minute until I find out a key ingredient or item is missing. If I had known that during my order, I wouldn't have ordered the rest if my items! I would have changed my meal planning into something else entirely. My feedback is that people need to know up front, while ordering if something is missing or unavailable. While they do this with limited items its not sufficient. The app needs to be updated or changed so that people know immediately while ordering if something is not available at their local store. There are enough tech savvy careers and intelligent people in this world to solve that issue and Walmart needs to be willing to compensate them adequately to get this problem solved or people, including myself will continue becoming so frustrated that they/we will be ending our service. We are subscribing for a service that is greatly lacking. Seriously...almost everytime, things in my order are missing and It's after I already paid and planned around those items!

I like how on target and Kroger you can make a grocery list and shop from that list on your app. I don’t see that option on the Walmart app. When I go to use the price checker it you always have to tap “got it” on the screen before you can scan anything. Like why do I have to read your message about “shopping smart with scanner” every single time? The app was fine the way it was. I don’t even do these app reviews but I felt kinda strongly about them changing the app because when I do shop there I always use the app. Only reason I gave it a 3star was because the convenience of Walmart pay. I wish I could still get my paper receipt when I use Walmart pay as well. At least there should be an option whether or not the customer wants it printed. I use rebate apps and often need my receipt.

Unless you know exactly what you want, browsing is an absolute nightmare. And typing in key words, like, gluten free, will only bring up about half of what the store has. Stuff I saw in store that’s gluten free, didn’t even show up when I searched gluten free, and this is with everything, not just gluten free. That’s was an example. Also I’m sick of stuff showing up as being in the store, you get there and it isn’t there, and if you dare ask for help, employees stand there and argue with you. That’s if you can even find an employee to argue with. Stuff that says unavailable will be available and don’t get me started in the price difference of what it shows you it is online, even if you choose in store or pickup, the vital price in store is usually more expensive. So it lies and then again employees argue with you over it. This app gives me anxiety opening anymore because you can’t just simply pick a department and see everything that’s in it. HATE it.

First off I’m going to begin with when I was in the app I clicked on the little thing at the bottom that ask you if you want to give feedback and when I was doing that as I was typing it just erased everything that I had and made me start over that’s already a red flag. So, I’d like to say the new user interface design is garbage quite literal garbage all right. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the old app … nothing wrong. So for example now when you click on an item it has the stupid pop-up instead of just bringing you to another page. Which is extremely annoying and does not look good. Next, you can no longer add items to your list in the app. Now I don’t know about the people working for Walmart but having that ability in a mobile app is very important nowadays. I am not going to sit here and turn on my computer or open my laptop to add items to my list. On top of that for a good amount of time at the beginning of this unneeded unwanted app update you could not scan any receipts now I figured out that you have to now go to your history just to scan a receipt. The old app you did not have to go through all of that you just clicked on the scanner which could be used for receipts, and products.

It wastes everyone’s time, plus this is just further exposure during an activity that’s supposed to be darn near contactless. This applies to the site as well, both of these things could be better. Also, sometimes when I search for something, it’ll bring up only certain options but when I select one and then look at “similar items,” it’ll show me more options of what I actually want. For example, if I look for “Kiwi protector spray” to find Kiwi protector spray for a tent, the single thing that comes up is Kiwi Camp Dry Performance Fabric Protector Spray (which is not exactly what I want).

I told her that would actually be my preference rather than getting a refund, especially since the refund would take several days and I needed the items right away.  At the time, I had no way of knowing that the cs rep COULD NOT enter the replacement in the system right then and the only choice was a refund. She was VERY RUDE in her way of clarifying it, even stating that she “could not go out and find the package wherever it is and give it to me” in a VERY condescending tone. Of course I replied that I knew that wasn’t an option and that would not be expected of her, and I also didn’t appreciate the tone in which she spoke. \\nI’m not sure how Walmart handles such a situation as this; however, I am a loyal customer who shops in the stores and online regularly. I’m sure cs calls with customers are recorded.  I don’t think ANY customer should be handled I in that manner. \\n\\nThank you.',\n",

Twice, over half my items were being overcharged at the register. I now must take photos of shelf prices before going to the register to check out. Many are small differences that most people likely won’t notice. Yesterday’s and this morning’s app experience was disappointing. App provided the option for a ship to store / store pick up at the beginning of the mattress order for the  Glasgow Ky Walmart which I’ve done before for a job site there. But this time the app only allowed the mattress to be shipped to my home address once in the checkout app area. I called Walmart support last night. The customer service agent was courteous and stated to try the order this morning as he would have the tech department resolve the issue. However, issue not resolved and had to accept the mattress to be shipped to home address which in this case’s circumstances is quite  inconvenient. I don’t like complaining but I am submitting this review to hopefully encourage Walmart to resolve this kind of problem including the app and in store pricing problems which is sort of a” bait and switch “ scenario; intentional or unintentional: the end result is the same.',\n",

I also think it’s strange that they are recently constantly sold out in the stores, but that third party vendor has them for double the cost. Makes me wonder if the vendor is getting a deal, buying them up from the stores and doubled the price. These have recently became popular items. The only other thing with the app is their online grocery delivery isn’t up to speed with competitors. The competitors have your shoppers communicate with them as they shop. That way if they are out of something, and find something better, they instantly give you the option rather than not getting a substitute or getting a substitute that is completely wrong. I would like to see them bring that up to what the competitors offer. Plus I have had two deliveries just not show and had to contact Walmart through the chat for delivery and then been disconnected from chats. Other than that I love the convenience and I hope they continue to do delivery and bring the process up to what their competitors offer.',\n",

The employees are often very unhelpful and when I had them price check 5 items for me while checking out and each item I no longer wanted was met with glares and rude responses like I was inconveniencing them. They took out all in store price checkers and ruined the app, all which could be fine if I wasn’t frequently met with rude and unhelpful employees. I used to go to Walmart very frequently and now I try to avoid it due to how inconvenient it has become, and if they don’t fix the app I will have no reason to go there anymore as it has become stressful and annoying between the new app and unhelpful employees.

I often have things in my Walmart cart either accumulating for my next grocery pickup order or waiting until I have more things to purchase.  With the new setup, I can’t place a grocery order without also checking out for everything else or vice versa place a shipping order without checking out my grocery pickup.  In addition, once a grocery pickup order was placed I cannot find any way to add items to the order.  The app says you can add items, but provides no clear way to do so like the previous version (and I did make sure the items I wanted were available for pickup). I ended up having to switch to the old app version, which has no record of my scheduled pickup, and try to accumulate enough to meet the minimum requirement to place a new order.  Honestly, since the beta update this app has been nothing but frustration at every turn.  Switching back to the old version isn’t the answer either, because that seems to have a bug that doesn’t let me check in for pickups. Please fix the app!!',\n",

This app was a solid 5 star app and now it’s a 2-3 star app at best! It continually tries to switch my items to shipping instead of adding them to my delivery items. The new layout is not as simple and straight forward….when shopping for my groceries, I’d prefer a convenient and succinct experience over a fancy and congested layout. The old app had your previously purchased items at the top of the page, this new app has them spread out through the list and the font (that states the previously purchased information) is small and harder to see among the overly crowded and busy layout. This new look makes shopping so much more difficult and I just don’t understand why Walmart would feel the need to mess up a perfectly well work app. The whole experience makes me almost unwilling to use Walmart over Kroger for my grocery deliveries….and almost may not be enough to keep using it, to be honest.

The “new” and “improved” app has taken it away from you. Most items don’t even show up when scanned saying “barcode not found” or “try again”. Then, if you scan a clearance item, it now says “out of stock” even if there are clearly 20+ in front of you. And in order to even see a price at all, you have to click on the item and find the product. Then the price isn’t correct. Oh- here’s the best part. Think you want to check a price in store? Wrong.

They don’t see the orders either. In fact, she told me the order number I gave her belonged to someone else. While on an extended hold with the call center the order became visible. With the problems of last month still fresh in my mind I canceled both orders and re-ntered them. We’ll see what tomorrow’s delivery brings.',\n",

The problem is when I scan in my receipts or type in the TC# manually it always comes back receipt added with a green check mark. The first four or five items show up in the main purchase history listings but when you click to get the full list from that just scanned in receipt it comes back blank not showing any of the items. Further when you click the receipt icon within the detail page it comes up blank not showing the receipt or any of its information at all. This happens usually on every other scanned in receipt. Sometimes I get lucky and three or four will work properly but it’s usually every other one. I cannot find where to contact the actual app developers. I tried chatting with a customer service representative several months ago but clearly he had no clue what I was talking about as no corrective updates were ever released and I continue to have the same problem. It’s very frustrating as now I have to hold on to the paper receipts that didn’t process properly. Due to this issue I can’t in good conscience recommend this app as the frustration and aggravation this causes is just not worth it. I sincerely hope they find the cause of this problem and release a corrective update. I have been using the app for years and never had this problem before.',\n",

It constantly deletes items in my cart!! They’re in stock so that’s not the problem. It just decides when I click on the cart to submit my order, let’s delete everything. Or it’ll leave a few things and I have to backtrack and try to remember what is missing which is the worst when I had 50 items. I’ll try to workaround the issue and checkout with the $35 minimum and later add more items to the order. Even that backfired on me just now. I reviewed my updated order and half my items are missing again. Some weeks, I don’t notice until after I picked up the order that several items never made it through. I update the app constantly thinking this glitch will get corrected and it never does. \\n\\nA new issue I have is my favorites aren’t fully loading. Since it was recently changed in the app, now only half my list loads. Then it brings me back to the top. I try to then filter it by category to see the items that don’t load and even that isn’t helpful. The filter options don’t let you scroll down to see all the categories. So annoying. \\n\\nBring back the separate Grocery app please!!! Why take away something that was super helpful and quick?! I dread ordering groceries 1-2x a week since the app went away.

I went all the way to the done button on the order both times!

Finally spoke to somebody in the delivery dept. and he told me he could not cancel my order, the woman I spoke to at the beginning needed to do that.

When I went into the app just before my pickup time the following day to initiate the pickup, my order had been canceled. No explanation. I wasted another 30-45 minutes of my time in an online chat trying to find out why my order had been canceled. All they told me was that the item was no longer available.

They said that a driver checked in to get my groceries which caused the system that was supposed to be down to send the email and charge my card.  The associate didn’t have a clue what to do but the fact that a driver showed up and my card was charged seemed funny to her. She just kept giggling and saying call back tomorrow and let the manager fix it. We can’t do anything ‘cause’ the system is down. It sounded like they were having a party. I called the store and asked to speak to the manager on duty. After the operator interrogated me for 5 minutes I was placed on hold and 30 minutes later hung up on. This is the 3rd time I have been charged for an order that was never picked and the 3rd time the manager on duty failed to pickup the call.   DO NOT USE ANY SERVICES ON WEEKENDS OR AFTER 3 pm.

He didn’t just multiply the one I’d already rung in, that, btw, is doubled in price and half the size of what it was 10 years ago. He did something on a cell type device; to which made it impossible to use EBT, so I had to put it on my credit card. Then my credit card was compromised to a point of confusion and I couldn’t bring that candy back nor fix my credit card for some odd reason!!! I’ve shopped at this store since it opened. Never have I seen such a lot of untrained people and managers incapable of help and online telling me they can’t help either??? So, please regional, maybe you need to take a look at training people as I appreciate self check out very much.

There I was at check out ready to edit all the substitution for the items in my cart if they were unavailable. When I saw there was no longer an option to physically choose my own substitutions anymore. Yes there was an option to “allow” for substitutions. But it seems the shopper would choose my substituted item. Instead of allowing my to choose what I wanted to be substituted for. There used to be a way that I could go through each item and choose what I wanted to substituted the item for. Now after the update it looks like I have to let you guys choose what to substitute the item for. The description said “You’ll get an item that’s as good or better at no extra cost” but I don’t trust Someone else to make that call on my behalf. It was much better when I was able to choose my own substitution. I immediately closed the app and decided to head to the store in person later. (Am I wrong about this update? Because it doesn’t able to let me choose anymore) Thank you and good day',\n",

If the registers are all down does no one get to buy anything, even when they’re back up and running? \\n\\nThere is no soul to online shopping, making it very cheap for those large enough to make good shipping  contracts.

Also if when you get home and realize you’re missing an item you can just called customer service run back to the store and pick it up no problem or if you need to do a return simply start the return in the app and if you need to take it back to the store it’ll give me a barcode to show them. They’ll scanning the barcode, then the item and that’s it. No more needing to spend hours in the store or forgetting what you needed. Simply place an order, check in the app, pull into a parking space, they’ll load your car and off you go. Yes it’s really that simple',\n",

This one would be also except for new changes, and I do not seem to be the only one. I have been using the Walmart app and home delivery service since 2019. It was an absolute lifesaver during the pandemic. However, the new version of the app no longer allows you to choose how you want your substitutions, just that you do or do not want that item substituted. So, it’s a crap shoot on what you get. It also used to have your commonly shopped items on an easy to find list. Now there is a quick add button for the items in your last order, but I don’t always again need everything on that list the next time I’m shopping. I also despise that, even when I choose the delivery option, items that are not in stock still show up, and if you aren’t careful, that giant thing of toilet paper or bottled water shows up in the “to be shipped” section at checkout. Then, I have to go back and find something in stock at the actual store. It’s a level of attention and lack of ease that is annoying. Don’t get me wrong…I have saved a ton of time and money using this app. It’s just a shame to see something that once was so user friendly become much less so.',\n",

For example, the app has told me for a month solid that the store doesn’t have the bakery bade ‘freshness guaranteed’ French bread (they show ciabatta of that brand in stock though, so it’s not just bakery items); blueberries have shown out of stock for a month; and today they said no kraft Mac n cheese, yet when I went in after picking up my order, there were many on the shelf. \\nIt’s MADDENING!

Some of the small items that ship separately don’t show up because a driver will find another gig along the way and cancel your order. To resolve this I’m having to call customer support because chat or automation will not correct the issue, and when calling, I sometimes can’t get through and have to try again the next day. They will solve your issues, but it takes way to much time out of my day and then I don’t get the funds back right away, instead I have to wait a week. That’s extremely frustrating since food prices are so high, people shouldn’t have to wait on $250 worth of their money to be refunded because Walmart delivered the groceries to wrong house or the driver just kept it? Who knows! The orders that do show up typically have missing items or damaged items. The damaged items have to be brought back to the store for a refund and that’s extremely inconvenient for a smashed tomato or cracked eggs!

       "  'review': 'I’ve had Walmart plus for a couple of years now. It was pretty handy when I lived in town and was getting all of my groceries delivered. If you’re doing that then it’s probably worth it. However if you live remotely it is not really that useful. If you order groceries for pick up and they don’t have everything available Walmart changes the location of your grocery pick up to the store that is shipping out to you. In our case that puts our grocery pick up five hours away. It’s ridiculous! And it’s really hard to get it to change. The app is not user-friendly and it is hard to navigate. It used to be easy to get refunds on damaged items or bad produce, but now you frequently have to actually call into  customer service to get them to refund you without having to take it back into the store. Finally many of the items that you can order for delivery are marked up so high that I don’t think anybody would ever pay for them. Like $70 for a few cans of beans. So again if you’re living remotely it’s not much used to you at all. Walmart has enough money they could do way better job on this app and providing the proper updates. They should also actually have affordable options for delivery. Not just on some things.',\n",

I could continue my shopping anytime I was at my laptop and everything I had entered on my phone showed up in the cart. It was so helpful as I tend to forget things if I don’t take care of it right away. Since they changed the app it no longer does that. Also it was handy to add items to my recent order from my phone if I forgot anything and now it try’s to make it a new order. So that’s another thing that no longer works. If there is anything I can do to fix the communication between my devices I would love to know. That’s my main complaint and why I only gave it two stars.

You certainly can’t beat their prices on staples or canned goods, their produce is surprisingly (amazingly) fresh, and their selections are excellent. I have learned not to order more obscure fruits/veg because they aren’t overly fresh, probably due to low demand. However, the more normal produce (asparagus, broccoli, apples, oranges, peaches and the like) are very, very fresh and I haven’t had a problem with someone else picking them out for me. My only negative comment is that some of the meat selection is limited and you don’t get sale prices. So I have regulars I order: bone in pork chops, whole chicken, fresh chicken tenders, and for the rest we grab from Staters or Albertsons. Oh! I was pleasantly surprised that they have EXCELLENT frozen, wild caught fish for pretty cheap! We buy the wild caught mahi-mahi for tacos, salmon and the tilapia (unfortunately that’s farm raised).

The associate said “I don’t know what to say I can’t help you” heading to electronics the associate at the counter said “I don’t know what to say I don’t know the app process I can’t help you” I asked to speak to a supervisor to come up with an solution plan; once the supervisor arrived he was so flustered on the situation he asked an associate who was on lunch to assist while he walked away from the situation.

One item said it was delivered but the picture is not a picture of my front door nor is the item in the picture big enough to be my item.  The delivery driver decided they needed it more than I did.  They said they can only refund me the money and I can buy it again.  So wasting more time buying it again and finding out they are out of the item now and won’t get it for another 2 1/2 weeks.  The other item was cancelled by the store because they couldn’t find a driver. So instead of just dropping it in the mail they just cancel the item even though they have it in stock.  Don’t give you a chance to pick it up at the store. Another call to them which they tell me there is nothing they can do but refund the money so I can buy it again but at the non sale price. Really!?  They then say they can give me a $10 coupon which is still going to cost me more for the item.  Finally they said they would give me $15 which is close to what I bought it at.  They don’t care about the customer and only allow them to do the bare minimum even when they fail to deliver what you order.',\n",

I’ve been using the app religiously since the pandemic began and have had very few issues, most issues were with the employees at the pickup location, no fault of the App. About a few weeks ago, I realize there’s been updates to the app. HORRIBLE updates. You can’t find half of the items that you know are in store on the app, adding items to an existing order is a pain, you add the items then for some reason when I come back to the app about an hour later to add maybe one more item, my cart still shows the previous items that I’ve already added STILL sitting in my cart which starts a whole issue of “Wait, am I stupid or didn’t I just add those things 30 mins ago??” Which easily leads to double ordering if you don’t go back into the order to verify if those items are there or not. Another NEW issue is the hold on funds. This NEVER happened before the update but now, they put the hold on funds from the account, the “hold” expires and about a week after you pick up your order, the funds actually deduct from your banking account. That’s just asking for a bunch of people to get confused and possibly overdraft accounts. Get it together Walmart. Seriously. It was FINE before.',\n",

I can’t see all the products as it cuts off half the first column. I have to open them to check sizes, etc. Despite this being a pick up order, it kept switching my products to shipping. It’s hard to find what I want because it’s mixed in with a thousand other products that are shipping only or bulk items. It took me three times as long to make my order. When I got to the end, it still had some products shipping to me, and I had to fix that before placing order. Horrible experience. New is not always better. The old app was perfect. I feel like Walmart intentionally “updated” to an archaic app to drive buyers back into the store. Must be losing money because we aren’t making impulse buys on the app. If I have to go inside and do my own shopping, I’ll just go back to my old store where it’s not as crowded and there are fresher veggie and meat options.

Another time I ordered a different blanket and it wasn’t in a bag or box. It was placed directly on the floor and the other things that I ordered were delivered into the wrong building,  each time I would have to go find my package. At the end of December I went on to cancel my subscription because the free trial was over instead of letting me cancel, gave me a free 14 more days, which I did not ask for and then yesterday $100 comes out of my account for the annual fee which I never wanted to keep. I try to cancel it on the app, and it told me I would not get a refund because I accepted the terms.

Early the next day, I got a phone call from someone in customer service who apologized for the glitch.  I was amazed at the level of concern for me, just a regular customer.\\n\\nI follow the business practices of retailers.  I am always pleased when a corporation takes care of its workers and pays them well.  I know Walmart does well in that area, but I would really like to hear that Walmart pays its associates better than anyone else and sees to it that they have great insurance and benefits.  You have a wonderful work force.  Please takes good care of them.  They do good work.',\n",

We now have to click on a million buttons to go thru our shopping list. If I’m adding items by way of the items I usually buy instead of having them all in one big list it’s now divided into pages. If I need to search for a item I want to add and then go back to my most shopped for item it then takes me all the way back to the start of my list and I then have to try to remember what page I was on when I clicked away. This is incredibly annoying and takes up time that I just don’t have! Especially when I’m running against a clock to get a order in on time!!!! Please fix this or bring back the grocery app. We also need a easier way to search for past grocery orders and start a return. I spent 15 mins trying to track down my last order only to find that they didn’t include it because they were out of the item this past time. Usually I could have found that info in seconds. I was a huge fan of both apps but this needs to be fixed',\n",

I made my choice and with the exception of the pick up time, I thought I was all set. Ten minutes after my pick up time I received a text stating the order was cancelled due to the item being out of stock. At the time I was en route to the store. I went to the pick up area to ask what was going on and was told the item was out of stock. I asked why wasn’t I told the day before and the clerk said the pick up items are pulled the day of pick up. Even though I placed my order first, someone was allowed to come in after I placed my order and now I don’t get the item and my money is tied up for three to five business days. I wasn’t given the option to choose another item nor get a cash refund to try to purchase the item elsewhere. There are numerous flaws in this procedure with the online customer getting screwed.

I caused a back up bcz I’m elderly, slow, very sick and don’t understand the technology of how to use the self check out. This is a disservice. You are not offering discounts for someone in my condition to put themselves thru this torture. A few days later, I found out that the check out clerks are all mandatorily scheduled at the same time. Which means that they are all off at the same time. Why would you do this? That means that you are keeping the store open without it being properly serviced. Do you want to lose money by customers deciding not to come to your store because they can’t get any service? I hope that you remedy this problem. It is not a situation, it is a problem. Schedule at least three checkers at a later schedule so that they there till closing. You’ll make more money and the people will be satisfied.',\n",

My address is correct in the Walmart system and I even put it in the instructions for the drivers along with my phone number for them to text me when they arrive.

Sometimes I can force it to put them back in the cart by selecting a delivery time even if I’m not ready to but much of the time I just have to save them “for later” and then add them back one by one.

At one point, you were able to submit printed receipts via the app. Then, it was changed to where you have to use Walmart pay to get rebates on competitors prices. Some weeks, no prices were better. Other weeks I was getting several dollars back per receipt! Walmart released an email yesterday stating they would end this in May because their prices were often cheaper than their competitors. I feel that is a lie considering I usually get cash back from the app on 3/4 of the receipts submitted. I will use the app until May but after that I will delete it and shop with the competitors as opposed to doing all my shopping with Walmart. Most of the said competitors allow digital manufacturers coupons on their apps or loyalty cards. Walmart doesn’t have a loyalty card or an option for digital coupons on the app. It is virtually useless as I can do anything else from the app on their website. Once savings catcher is gone, it is a waste of space. I will be using the balance left over from the savings catcher and deleting this app. It literally will no longer provide me with any benefits that I cannot get from using the general website.

It literally takes days for me to see the final and correct amount adjusted in my bank account!!  And, unfortunately, I have had errors in how that entire process works.  Walmart makes it good and refunds the $$ amount each time-via my bank account.

This was at the beginning of the summer as Covid was winding down and supplies were fine. That’s just one instance. The decline of Walmart has been going on for years. It’s a sad, socialist, millennial run business that will fail, if they don’t get off of their rear ends and return the place to its customer and high quality product centered roots that it once had.

Since my app didn’t work, and there are no longer scanners, I took my items to customer service and had them scan them, wasting their time and mine, as well as backing up an already long line due to the current labor shortage.

We don’t need to see every option you have. \\n\\nOld Review: Loved the old version of the app. I’m very confused with the new lists. I just want to see my favorites. I saved them as favorites for a reason. I don’t want them lumped together with other items I’ve bought before. I think they are showing up in multiple places. My ‘Grocery Favorites’ are in random order and not sorted by category. Perhaps to make me go through the other list to see other items? Annoying. The app went from 5 to 3 or maybe 2 stars. Not user friendly like the previous version.',\n",

But.....again Walmart has won and now you don’t rack up the reward dollars like you used to. I spent $600-$1000 per month and would get a substantial amount accumulated and I would save it up and I would purchase a big item. I have used it toward a $70 iron to a $250 pool. I enjoyed scanning my receipts....waiting to see how much I was going to get in return.....then deciding how long I wanted to accumulate them. Now.... Not so much now .....  I still spend the same amount and in the past eight months I have only accumulated $7.89 🤗.  Not much of an incentive to drive out of my way to a Walmart so I can save a dollar or two and then get to scan my receipt and then see that I didn’t even have any qualifying items.  I will just support my small businesses because at least I know that all the registers will be open.....the employees will be friendly.....and the owners will desperately appreciate my business.',\n",

For several transactions I was charged twice and told “The extra charge funds will be returned to you in 3-5 business days”. But you see, those funds still tied up and unavailable during those 3-5 business days. They finally got that bug fixed. Also, there is no longer a way to browse the groceries by category. You have to manually search for every item you want. I assure you, if I could browse, Walmart would have a lot more of my money lol. And, if you want to add items on to an existing grocery pickup order it used to be a breeze-as long as it was in stock at the time, you could add it up to a certain cut off time. Now, when I add things it FREQUENTLY says the item is fulfilled differently and cannot be added to the order. HOWEVER, right under that message it says “available for pickup”….makes no sense. So if I make another order (to pick up on another day, and pay $5.99 bc its not $35 or more total) I can get a $2 box of crackers? No. Hopefully the app gets sorted better and is more user friendly in the near future.',\n",

I proceeded to say that he had arrived and was in spot 11 blue car and they said thanks we will be out soon! 25 minutes goes by and my husband messages me that they still haven’t brought out the pickup order, which is crazy, so I called to see what was going on. They said their system was saying that we were still a mile away and weren’t ready for pickup despite us checking in and telling them we were in a spot 25 minutes ago! She apologized and said that the system uses the location of the phone used to check in, and because I was still at home it didn’t register that we checked in…. which is silly because we checked in and said we were there waiting. SUCH A BAD SYSTEM. Reminds me why I stay away from Walmart in general. We only went there this time because they had 1 item that we couldn’t find anywhere else. Never again. Not worth the hassle.',\n",

I understand Walmart wants to move forward but due to the lack of their choice to remove the price scanners from their stores the app was very helpful with finding the prices for items in the store. And now we’re trying to find the price for an item in the store it will not allow me to know the price in store and only give me the online price. I completely hate it! I wish Walmart would look back and understand that the latest version or just the ability to see the price in store would be so helpful! So Walmart if you see this give us back the ability to see the in store price. Thank you!',\n",

You’re marketing for the younger crowd who have no set hours or sleep schedules, but leave no time for them to actually go in your stores and shop or get gas. Like sams gas stations close at 9pm? Like why? And I’ve been to almost every store (sams included)  in my area and every employe I’ve talked to literally has no clue what Walmart pay is or Walmart+. Most them were older but that shouldn’t matter.  Did y’all tell them about these things in a letter or something because they look really dumb not knowing?! Also you can’t use your Walmart credit card with Walmart pay at Murphy gas or Sams club/gas.

I want the option to see all (it says that is an option but still doesn’t give all like it use to).

When didn’t by 7:00 PM,I called and was told no drivers available.  They knew this all day and never called to notify customers.  Seems refused to come to work and make deliveries.

Unfortunately, it’s been several times, where Walmart had cancelled my order due to “delivery driver issues.” The most recent time, had led me to write this review and cancel my Walmart+ subscription. I placed a delivery order, which included infant formula that was indeed in stock. The order had a bunch of other household items, as well, but I specifically needed the infant formula. I reviewed a text message that my delivery was “on its way”, then about 15 minutes later received a text that the “delivery driver is approaching with my order.” So I go outside and wait for my order and literally 1 minute later, I received a text saying my order had “delivery driver issues and the store cancelled my order.”\\nWhen I called customer service, they couldn’t give me an explanation on what really happened, but that the store cancelled the order and it can’t be recreated and my money will be refunded to me within 7-1 business days. So here I am with no formula for my babies and out all of my money to purchase more for 7-10 days. I did receive an “I’m sorry, ma’am, I know this is an inconvenience to you.” NEVER AGAIN, WALMART!!',\n",

Also, with 5 daughters, it’s sometimes a hassle to deposit my cash, then go shopping, and to get my phone out and do the whole Walmart pay thing. On one of my visits, it froze up the whole self-check register and I had to re-ring my whole purchase at another register. Plus, using cash keeps me on a budget, and it’s just what I prefer.

I love that it can help me locate items, find prices on items that are out of place, tell me if what I am looking for is in stock at my Walmart or other local Walmarts. The only thing I am not to happy about is before they updated the app was the ability to use the list feature. It was and still is the thing I use the most in the app. Now with the update I can no longer edit/make lists from my phone. The fact that if I am at Walmart and want to add things to an existing list or start a new one I have to add the item to my cart and then add it to a list at home from my computer. It's time consuming and hard to remember vs back when I could have scanned a barcode and added the item to a list while in the store. I don't know why you had a feature that worked on the app in one version but lost it when you redid the app. Hoping the feature comes BACK soon.\",\n",

In their efforts to streamline things and put all things into one app they have produced a convoluted mess. Their delivery/pick up/in-store system is now all over the place. We were going to try out the Walmart + app for delivery but as of right now it's too frustrating. Every item holds the possibility of pick up delivery or in-store. And you will not know whether or not it is one of these until you check out. And then some items that are normally a grocery pick up item will claim that it is going to ship to you 2 to 3 days after your delivery of groceries. If you were thinking about trying Walmart + for delivery my suggestion would be don't even bother. I hope this helps.\",\n",

If I don’t know the specific item I’m looking for, no chance. Can’t find it. Only way to find something new that isn’t in previous purchases is to search each individual item. I can’t browse skincare items without being tossed out of the app. I can’t find anything, and it’s not from a lack of patience. Thankfully my recently purchased items are still available. \\n\\nSeriously, who let this update launch so prematurely? It’s garbage. I see their goal, but the execution is terrible.',\n",

Please check back later “ I updated the app and I have tried multiple devices. Lately, I can place an order on my iPad but not my phone. Today nothing works. It has not been more than 12 hours since I first tried placing the order. A few weeks ago it took 3 days and then I gave up and went to Publix instead.

Today the app said Express delivery was available, as I was checking out, so I chose that; got a message to choose a different time hours later. Then, inexplicably, I got a message that 2 items I chose weren’t available at the store that could deliver, but they would have been very easy to substitute (e.g. sour cream, would have been fine with different brand or size.) It took about an hour for checkout to actually work. I kept getting an error message that “something went wrong, try again later.” The “support” in the app was no help at all. I just tried again and got it to work about an hour later. I did nothing different, it just decided to start working.

What happened? It used to always show either the marked clearance price or a lower price from another markdown that wasn’t tagged. That makes it pretty useless. Why Walmart removed the scanner machines in store is beyond me! I guess they just want to force people to download this app that doesn’t work. I asked  a guy at Walmart and he said it’s a lot of trouble for the store to upload the current markdowns ! \\nIn addition to that, I needed a particular pet product that I always buy at my local Walmart. I couldn’t find it at a different store I happened to be at, so checked the app for availability at my usual store. It showed that it was not available at any of the nearby locations. Not trusting it, I stopped at my usual store and they had several bags in stock. So glad I did! \\nThis app is useless! Might work for online shopping but not for in store and local pickup shopping .

So that literally, is stealing. I’m sick over this because I cannot even imagine the amount of money Walmart has stolen from not only me, but all the other people this happens to. A dollar here, a dollar there… nobody even notices. Probably common practice on larger orders. I took screenshots to post evidence but unfortunately, I am unable to post pics.  Just heads up… check your orders!!!',\n",

It is also not obvious what mode of shopping you’re doing (delivery, pickup, shipping) so would be helpful to show a banner somewhere that shows what kind of basket you’re filling while shopping. The product search result algorithms are pretty bad also. Sometimes I have to search the *exact* name of a product, so that can be annoying. If I search “milk” for example I would assume all milk options would show up to pick from. Not always. Also would be helpful to be able to switch from pickup to delivery to shipping and ability to see what is available at another store (like targets app) more easily. If a bunch of things are not available in store I may opt to go to another location or ship the whole order instead, but I don’t want to make an entire new order to do that.',\n",

Maybe allow a person who gets the item in their cart to have 10 minutes to check out instead of having to button mash against a million other people and all the bots that are automatically set up to grab these items.  This has happened to me and others I know during Walmart’s specified online sale times for the next gen Xbox series X and the PS5.  I’d rather know immediately that I didn’t get it than keep going through consecutive small server freezes where it shows in my shopping cart, but then is gone while checking out or when the page continues to refresh when I try to move to the checkout page. Disappointing and frustrating that the system feels stuck in 1990’s dial up mode. If it is safe enough to have your stores open for holiday shopping your stores are safe enough to sell these consoles in person.  These computer bots have an unfair advantage over the every day person.  There will be many disappointed kids this year due to poor distribution policies of Walmart and others.',\n",

I scanned, I just couldn’t go. All of my items scanned in okay except for produce that needs to be weighed. I get that part and planned to pay for it separately. I purchased a medicine that required an ID check but when the tech tried to clear it, the register froze up. The app told me I needed to go to a regular register. 🙄 I get to the register, thankfully not a long line, and the cashier was completely clueless. Acted dumb when I told her to just scan the barcode like it said. After she did and you could see everything transferring, she had to go get someone to see it was okay. That was the most frustrating part. Walmart needs to train their cashiers!! Finally, I was afraid to close the scan and go part to cheek to see where a hard to locate item because when I scanned my first item, I tried to do that and it said there was nothing in my cart. 🤷🏻\\u200d♀️',\n",

We consistently have problems with this because our local Walmart removed the posted check-in phone numbers so he can’t call and say he’s there. We are now required to check in on the app which is on my phone. This means he messages me which spot he’s in and I check in with the app. And we’re fine with that. However the app requires my location services to be turned on so either they don’t deliver the groceries to the car until he flags somebody delivering to another car down or we have to call the main number and sit on hold. Today for the first time they called me and ask why I have chosen a spot when my phone says I’m not there. Every option seems to confuse the employees and and waste everyone’s time. So it’s just easier just to shop somewhere else.\\n\\nWalmart, either re-post the phone number or fix the app so it allows someone else to pick up.

I usually only use this service once a month so Walmart is making some money from me. If I do use it more than that I will still have to tip the driver. Well I guess it works out okay. I have had some issues with things I ordered. Especially if they were not grocery items . For example, I ordered a 44c bra but got a 38 c instead?? Go figure.

Now, I have to use the Walmart website and it isn’t very intuitive as it was when Lists were in the app. Please please please add this back - hopefully you guys are working on this. Other than that, great app (even after the major design update since I’m writing this review October 2021). Also, where’s Store Assistant? It’s like we’re taking design and sacrificing core features to the app! C’mon Walmart! Hopefully these features will be added back since they were really useful (at least to me).

I still get a physical receipt and I can still pay with cash if I choose and I’m getting cash back from Walmart? So honestly I think this app is great.

I have gone through everything from my account info , to every prompt to every page on the app and there is no accessible way to report anything wrong.

       "  'review': 'This new update is horrible!! When shopping in store and scanning items for price checks many items are coming up as either not in stock or item not found in store. I’ve tried typing the barcodes in manually but the issue still persists and it seems to mainly be the clearance items that it’s happening with. It really wouldn’t be such of an issue if the price of the supposed out of stock item would at least be displayed. Unfortunately because I’m unable to find out the prices of items I have to ask the cashier to do several price checks while I’m in line checking out and if I have many items needing to be price checked it can really be time consuming. I never had this problem with price checking items while shopping in store until this new update.',\n",

I offered to wait in line but she said it’s ok, come over here... they both said have a nice day... that would be a boring review... However, I am a white guy visiting Chicago and the entire store, staff and customers were African- American... I was not treated like a white man, just a customer, so I was treated so kind I would always beg to differ with any unkind comments about the people of Chicago coming from anybody else, ever.... I hope this is read by corporate and the staff of that entire store gets some kind of recognition and gift... Thank you so much people of Chicago Walmart on Cottage grove avenue 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍',\n",

I googled it and got a link to a subscriptions section in the app but the page just said I had none. No indication on how to add them on that page or in any product description or shopping cart.\\n2. I placed an order fora couple of household items I needed to give it a test. Same day delivery in a few hours! When the order was finally going to ship, I got conflicting messages in app, email, and text. They seemed to say that the two items I ordered were unavailable - W+ needs a better inventory system. BUT, in the app, it was unclear. Was it saying only one item wasn’t in stock? I don’t know and the system didn’t cancel the order for me. Seems like it was still going to happen. Was someone going to arrive at my house with nothing and take the $tip and go back? No idea. No indication of what was going on in the app. So i manually canceled.  No good feelings here to order anything again.',\n",

I use the Walmart app to scan items when I’m there but when I go to pay at the register the price is higher than the website. Walmart will not allow you to purchase the item unless you pay the higher price at the store. I was told the lower price is for online purchase only which make no sense to me since I am already at the store and ready to pay for the item. I though Walmart was in business to sale products not keep them at the store for MAYBE someone to buy them. I find myself leaving behind many items at the store because Walmart will not give you the lower price. I spent so much time searching and searching for things at the store to later leave them all behind. It’’s a waste of my time! I don’t even like going to the store anymore.

However, when I got to the register the items I had price checked scanned differently.  One item scanned in the app for $13 when I went to check out it  scanned for $30 another item scanned for $15 on the app, and when I went to check out it scanned for $35. I went to customer service and  I was advised that I would have to order it online wait for them to “pick it” and then come back to pick up my order!!!  REALLY…. the item that I have in front of me!!  I thought that Walmart had better customer service than this.! This is something that needs to be addressed especially during the Holiday season when everyone is using their apps to scan items then get to the register and it’s more than what it’s scanned for on the app. The app never stated that it was an online price only!!!

My guess is the app communicates with some signal in the store or GPS and then a map of the store comes up and whatever item you are looking for it will tell you what aisle it is in.  This works about half the time.  It seems to be turned on in some stores and turned off in others.  I find this VERY helpful.  \\n\\nI ordered something for pickup today.

Before when I could any method of payment and know that savings catcher would search and give me the best price, I simply used Walmart as my primary shopping source. Now with the requirements of Walmart Pay it’s not worth the aggravation. The functionality of the process is slow, problematic and not shopper/customer friendly. Most times the cashiers can’t help because they don’t understand it either. Even our Walmart stores have gone down since all these changes started. Shelves are not stocked regularly, the pickup tower is a disaster, scan and go cashiers don’t regulate the registers and let people cut line and not say anything, the stores aren’t as organized and clean as they once were, the meat and produce areas are not kept fresh. I no longer buy fresh meat or fruit there. It’s really sad and disappointing.',\n",

Then there’s the inventory availability/management, or lack thereof. Put some items in your cart, go to check out, only to discover half of them are now suddenly out of stock. Seems like that check could’ve been made a little earlier. They’re happy to substitute your items which they say are in stock, but which aren’t when they actually go to pick them. But offer a substitute at entry or checkout time? No that would make sense.

However, there are plenty of negative things to say about the app. \\n\\nUnfortunately I’m too tired from fighting with this app to write an extensive review, but I’ll share my experience from a moment ago. I was searching for 55” TV, and when I tried to apply the filter for TV sizes 50” - 59” the filter did not stick the first three or four times I tried it. It finally did filter to the appropriate screen size, and I then wanted to look at 60” TVs. No luck. The filter didn’t stick the next three times I tried it so I gave up. In the midst of this, I was also trying to sort by least to most expensive, and that sorting option was only respected some of the time.\\n\\nIt’s almost always frustrating to use this app, and I use it quite frequently. Even so, I do like having Walmart pay as an option if I forget my wallet, and it has worked well when I’ve used it. I also like the ability to scan items in the store for price checking. However, sometimes the scanned items are not found in the database.\\n\\nWalmart is one of the largest retailers in the world. It seems like they could develop an app that with properly functioning sort order and filters. \\n\\nIf it weren’t for Walmart pay and the barcode scanning feature, this would be a one star review.',\n",

I checked my saved addresses and saw that there were two different addresses saved. One in IL (different one than the futon was sent) and another in KY. So three total addresses were saved at my account that I never added. I can’t believe that the Walmart app isn’t secure enough to protect their customers information. You’d think with how much they make a year they would actually put money towards protecting their app. Now I’m out $200 plus the hassle of having to call to cancel my card and pay to get a new one.

Sooo, I can’t/won’t use it, which also means I can’t take advantage of Savings Catcher, which was a huge help to me and my family. \\n\\nYou should have kept it how it was! So easy. Scan the receipt, add it to recent purchases and Savings Catcher. If you wanted to make it easier on people, you could have kept both features-Scan or use Walmart Pay. What about customers like me? I have not been able to add so many receipts that I normally would have now that you changed it. I am not a happy customer, for sure. And all the many people that I told about your app and Savings Catcher and how it works before this change will be hearing from me about it now as well.',\n",

You are already a huge monopoly. Stop this unprofessional behavior. It’s robbery.

You also get free Paramount + with your Walmart + subscription. Refunds are easy if you do not receive an item or if the item you do receive is bad, or broken, they refund you immediately. I don’t have to go in store to grocery shop anymore or get things I need. This option is great for introverts lol! I really LOVE the Walmart CASH option. If you buy certain Walmart products/food they reward you with Walmart cash that you can use on your next order. 5 star experience. I’m happy and proud to pay that monthly fee. You ultimately save so much money and time with this option. Thank you for adding this.',\n",

You can still manage a list but what good is a list if you can’t actually build one. \\nPersonally I use the list function to gather options which I can then go back and make my purchase decision .. not any more, I guess. \\nI will still use the app since there are items from Walmart that I still wish to purchase now and in the future but sparingly.',\n",

The stores are already short staffed so finding someone to scan it for you, and wasting their valuable time, is difficult to say the least.

My most recent annoyance is Walmart pay. Kroger and Walmart need to bring in Apple, Samsung, and other digital wallet payments. I tried doing the Walmart pay and “scan and go” features, yet they never work. By the time it loads, I am already back in my car from having everything scanned by myself (or the one cashier they have with a long line) and using a regular card. Walmart pay is so annoying, since you can’t pull it up easily like the other digital payments. They need to stop being greedy and allow for the other payment options (it is 2022 after all, and every other store has the option, even small businesses), or at least work on their own app so they can work in their store when you only get one or two bars.',\n",

Each time it tells me that it can’t process my card. Until the third or fourth time and then it will finally process. And that’s only one of many, many complaints that I have with this atrocious app! You took a perfectly good app and turned it into absolute garbage! You do realize that like EVERY grocery store does pick up and delivery now, right??

In July, I would have quickly given a 5-star review. However, since the latest update, which I couldn’t refuse on my i-phone, nothing scans in-store with accurate pricing. 95% of the time it only shows an online price, an inaccurate store price, or very frequently simply says the item is unavailable or the barcode doesn’t exist. This is despite the fact I’m standing in the store holding the item, or in front of a shelf full of said item(s). \\nPLEASE make the price checker be accurate for your stores. When the stores don’t make prices visible with the frequent shifting of inventory, we need to be able to know how much something costs. And with most store employees no longer having scanners, due to them being used for pick-up orders, there are not other options. Thank you.',\n",

I want some fried potato wedges, and maybe a rotisserie chicken? Or the chicken salad (grapes, walnuts, etc). I can’t find a way to do that. Other grocery stores (ingles)  have that option.

They don’t pay thier employees a living wage or healthcare. when Walmart  moves into your town thier business plan is to undercut the prices of all the competitors in the area until thier out of business then they raise thier prices because they are the only store in town you can go to. They destroy mom and pop businesses everyday. Also they rely on the federal government to pay for thier employees healthcare. I would love to see Walmart put up a statistic showing how many of thier work force receive public assistance just to make ends meet.a huge population of  the working poor. That is what Walmart has to offer America. We need to boycott these greedy billionaires out of our country. This is far from what Sam Walton had in mind people. Corporate greed. How can we squeeze a few more penny’s out of the most vulnerable in our society. I’m sure Walmart spends millions on think tanks just to figure that out.',\n",

I use the app a lot in store to scan prices since a lot of things are not in the correct place- I know staffing is probably difficult at the moment so that’s not my real issue. The problem- among many- is that I can physically be holding the product in my hand and it says out of stock and will not give a price. Prices don’t match up- and yes I’m looking at the in store price. Searches are not user friendly. The app redirects me to the website for reasons I haven’t figured out. If stores are not going to have price scanners in the store then the app should at least give a price, and give an accurate price. I always do self checkout because there are usually just a couple of lanes with cashiers. If I scan something and the price doesn’t match what the app said the in store price is, I have to wait on assistance from employees to approve the void. Walmart can do better, much better.',\n",

And forget using this app in the store! It used to be able to help you find an item while you were in the store but now all it does is try to add it to your cart - which won’t be the pickup option cart, it’ll be ship only cart - so you can’t even find it in the store!\\nSeriously feel like this most recent major update, destroyed all of the usability. I do not understand why this could even be called an update when it rendered the app unusable',\n",

Unfortunately, Walmart is determined to protect the data they collect on their customers and implemented an inferior Walmart Pay solution that is reliant on an internet connection. This might be ok if they offered WiFi that worked or ensured that at least the big 3 wireless carriers worked in their stores. Instead, I have about a 10% success rate using those methods in-store. The WiFi never works and wireless is hit or miss. Instead, I have to connect to a 3rd party WiFi in these stores and hold up the line for 5 minutes.

HOWEVER, the app was personally ruined for me after they decided to remove scanning paper receipts for savings after paying. People forget to scan at the counter or sometimes don’t bring their phone into stores, making them unable to do something they would gladly do if they didn’t forget. Also, Walmart may not realize that there are customers with anxiety and try to get in and out of the store ASAP. Said customers don’t have the time to pull out their phone, especially in stores with bad internet, to try to scan their barcode and be in the store any longer/ or try to fumble around and freak out if the scan doesn’t work in store. That leads to giving up for searching for savings, which is the biggest reason I’m sure most people have this app. \\n\\nTLDR; Walmart messes up huge with the update.',\n",

I am trying to be compassionate because I know that many organizations are short staffed at this moment in time, but if you’re placing an order 45 hours in advance, I still don’t understand why pick up is not available.

I’ve always preferred Walmart because the app was easy to use, easy to search, and easy to periodically add stuff to my cart throughout the day before I checkout. \\n\\nBut what in the world was this update even supposed to accomplish? The items in the lefthand column are cut off- I can’t even see the prices. Then, many items are added for delivery instead of pickup, automatically. Why? Who designed this and why are you still employed? I’ve avoided doing grocery pickup at competitors because of the poor app design, and now y’all are running neck and neck with this crap. I have no reason to keep my loyalty at Walmart at this point.',\n",

Meaning the only way you can use Savings Catcher is if you use Walmart Pay to checkout.  For families or those of us whose spouses are less digitally inclined, this means you can no longer scan their store receipt after they’ve gone shopping without you and add it to Savings Catcher.

I usually have to use the search bar to find exactly what I need. The app is also glitchy - the page will jump while you’re scrolling so that you lose your place and have to scroll back up. Finally, my main complaint - WHY is there not a way to specify how you want your deli meat sliced? It’s ridiculous that this isn’t an option. If I need deli meat, I won’t even bother ordering pickup or delivery because I have to go to the store to tell them how I want it sliced. This shouldn’t be so difficult.',\n",

Such a headache to locate in stock items. Then, once I do make a purchase, I get notified that my order is delayed indefinitely. I finally called the store after 24 hours of delay and they had my order waiting for me since they had filled it on time. So frustrating! The functionality of the new updated app is horrible—and I seem to be the only one with this new interface. I keep deleting it to redownload and revert to the old version.

If I ordered one item at a time, I would need to pay shipping on them.  If there is an update on this app, it definitely is NOT working. Very frustrating trying to place an order. Please fix it ASAP.                                                                Still not working even after waiting several days, please fix it.',\n",

Four minutes later I received texts that my substitutions AND my order is ready for pickup at the same time. I was not able to approve my substitutions at all, and some of them were inappropriate. I also could not claim a return for bad/wrong products since these option were not available. This app WAS great, but these so called “improvements” have made it an exercise in inconvenience. If not corrected then I see no reason to use it and will go back to in-person shopping.',\n",

So I called, and called, and called, and called - guess what?? No answers at all, plus the voicemail said they close at 7:00??? So I contacted support again, to be told they can’t call the store and they are just waiting on a driver.... no expected delivery time. So it’s almost 8:00 and I’m wondering if I’m going to be able to eat tonight, all my money is on hold because you can’t order without it doing that. \\n\\nDON’T EVER GET THE DELIVERY OPTION!!! You will regret paying $9 for delivery on top of the price of the food and taxes.',\n",

Refunding can be all done from your own door and in the comfort of your own home. It’s never a bad day with Walmart!! 10+ stars',\n",

If I hit submit it says update app. So after trying on both phones I finally found that I have to use Walmart pay to be able to submit!!! Not okay! I only have a Bluebird AMEX & they already took away my ability to save up & load saving on that. I don’t save my card to my phone or on apps but now will have to save it to the Walmart Pay. I get paid in cash, so now to use it I will have to hold up the line to first load my Bluebird with the cash & then get items rung up to use it to pay (& Walmart will pay the AMEX processing fees 💰 on what would have been a cash purchase!!!)',\n",

I was scanning items as I placed them in my shopping cart so I could get an idea of how much I was spending because I'm on a tight budget. Once I started and had a few items scanned and placed in the app cart I figured out it was only placing items that could be used with the scan & go. So that was no help but entering an item to look up where it is located I liked. Don't have to walk the store over which is great for me as I have severe back issues. \\n\\nIf there were a way to scan and keep a running total of all your items as you shop in store that would be wonderful. Especially for us that are on a budget. But there might already be and I just haven't figured it out.\",\n",

Also, even after exiting the app and leaving the store after my pickup, the app is still using my location despite having “Only while using the app” selected.
